                    We are Royal Bakers and we love baking cakes, bakes and desserts.
                    With this pure, sweet sentiment, we founded our company and opened our first bakery in colombo 07, 2004.
                    We are delighted to help our guests celebrate and spoil themselves everyday!
                    We offer an incredible range of baked treats.
                    Cupcakes, celebration cakes, brownies, pies, cheesecakesâ€¦ or perhaps the Monthly Special? Honestly, we don't think you can go wrong.
